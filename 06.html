                <p class="bio2">Hand-Painted Playing Cards is a project inspired by Tobias Levin's <a href="http://www.tobiaslevin.com/handdrawncards">Hand-Drawn Cards</a>. While Levin's work focused on solely creating the back design by hand, my cards took another approach of individually hand drawing each face card, adding my own stylization to the four aces. In embelishing the faces, I focused on the imagery of hands to emphasize the hand-created identity of the cards as well as the purpose of being used by one's hands. The process involves creating a solution between a heavy body acrylic paint and a gloss acrylic medium in order to create a easily thinned out texture, that when used, would not effect the slickness of the deck of cards. The mixture is applied to both the faces and backs of each blank card using a brush and is then left out to dry. Once close to fully dry, the cards are individually put under a weight and eventually put together again in a stack with another weight upon them. The result is a deck of playing cards with a unique hand-painted quality that does not affect its usability and performance at all.
